# Hermes Dock

A central **dock** run by a **Hermes administrator agent** that governs siloed **observation decks**, one per AI-agent project. This is a fresh project, separate from Aureus and meant to replace it.

## How the requirements map to the code

| Requirement | Where |
|---|---|
| Central dock run by Hermes | `hermes_dock/station.py` — `Station`, `Station.hermes()`, `Station.review()` |
| Hermes reviews work | `deck_status`, `run_audits` tools; `review()` runs auditors then Hermes |
| Builds / recruits agents, replaces weaker ones | `recruit_agent`, `supplant_agent` (bumps the agent's `generation`), `retire_agent` |
| Evolves as it learns | `record_learning` — lessons, strategy notes and a self-rewritten, versioned playbook fed back into every Hermes run |
| Strategy and online research | Hermes runs with Anthropic's hosted `web_search` tool; `hermes-dock research "<question>"` |
| Tiers: one manager per deck reporting to Hermes | `hermes_dock/deck.py` — manager (tier 1) delegates with `assign_task`, reports with `report_to_hermes`; workers (tier 2) can't delegate or report |
| Decks siloed, connected only to the station | each deck gets a `DeckSilo` (path-guarded directory) and an uplink closure, nothing else |
| Auditors stress-testing every deck | `hermes_dock/auditors.py` — `hermes-dock audit`, or `hermes-dock watch` for continuous rounds |
| Hermes can code, transform or erase decks | `create_deck`, `transform_deck` (versioned, full history), `erase_deck` (archived first; goes through approval) |

Every agent's tools are scoped to its tier. If an agent calls a tool it wasn't given, the call is refused.

## Starter decks

Templates live in `hermes_dock/deck_templates/`:

- **Emittime Lab** (`emittime-lab`): the mission is still a placeholder (`[OWNER TO DEFINE]`). Until you define it, the crew drafts a mission brief for Hermes to adopt. You can also set it yourself with `hermes-dock ask "transform emittime-lab: mission is ..."`.
- **3D Asset Render Lab** (`render-lab-3d`): demand scout → asset spec → Blender Python build script → technical QA.
- **Online Sales Lab** (`online-sales-lab`): product research → listings/offers → unit economics/pricing → customer-ops drafts. Spending, publishing and customer contact always need approval.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...        # or `ant auth login`

hermes-dock init                    # station + 3 decks in ./.hermes
hermes-dock status
hermes-dock cycle render-lab-3d     # one manager-led operating cycle
hermes-dock audit                   # all auditors, all decks
hermes-dock review                  # Hermes: audit → act → learn
hermes-dock watch --minutes 60      # continuous audit + review loop
hermes-dock approvals               # what's waiting on you
hermes-dock approve <ticket>        # or: reject <ticket>
hermes-dock memory                  # Hermes' lessons, strategy, playbook
```

Add `--offline` to any command to use the deterministic offline backend (no API calls).

## Autonomy

The station starts **supervised**: deck erasures and every external action (spend, publish, contact) go into the approval queue. `--autonomy autonomous` lets Hermes erase decks on its own. External actions still always need a human.

## Model

Agents run on Claude (`claude-opus-5-5` by default; override it with `HERMES_DOCK_MODEL`). They use adaptive thinking, per-agent effort, and server-side refusal fallback. The brain sits behind the small `Backend` protocol in `hermes_dock/llm.py`, so you can swap in another agent runtime, such as a self-hosted Nous Research Hermes model, without touching the station.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The tests cover silo enforcement, manager→worker delegation, tool scoping by tier, approval gating, deck creation/transformation/supplanting, Hermes memory evolution, cross-deck leak detection, and the Claude request shape.
